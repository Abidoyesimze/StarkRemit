# StarkRemit User Guide

Welcome to StarkRemit! This guide will help you understand how to use the gasless remittance system on Starknet.

## What is StarkRemit?

StarkRemit is a revolutionary system that allows you to send money to phone numbers without paying gas fees. It's built on Starknet and uses a sophisticated paymaster mechanism to sponsor gas fees, making remittances accessible to everyone.

## How It Works

1. **Send Remittance**: You send STRK tokens to a phone number hash
2. **Gas Sponsorship**: The paymaster contract sponsors gas fees for claims
3. **Claim Remittance**: Recipients can claim their money gaslessly
4. **Automatic Refunds**: Unclaimed remittances are automatically refunded after 90 days

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Starknet wallet (e.g., Argent, Braavos)
- STRK tokens for remittances and fees
- Phone number of the recipient

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Open your Starknet wallet
2. Connect to the StarkRemit dApp
3. Ensure you have sufficient STRK balance

### Step 2: Send a Remittance

1. Enter the recipient's phone number
2. Enter the amount you want to send
3. Review the fee (typically 10 STRK)
4. Confirm the transaction

**Example:**
- Phone: +1234567890
- Amount: 100 STRK
- Fee: 10 STRK
- Net amount received: 90 STRK

### Step 3: Recipient Claims Remittance

The recipient can claim their remittance in two ways:

#### Option A: Gasless Claim (Recommended)
1. Recipient connects their wallet
2. Enters their phone number
3. Clicks "Claim Gaslessly"
4. Receives the remittance without paying gas

#### Option B: Manual Claim
1. Recipient connects their wallet
2. Enters their phone number
3. Clicks "Claim Manually"
4. Pays gas fees and receives the remittance

## Understanding Fees

### Remittance Fee
- Fixed fee per remittance (default: 10 STRK)
- Covers system maintenance and sustainability
- Deducted from the total amount sent

### Gas Fees
- **Gasless Claims**: Sponsored by the paymaster
- **Manual Claims**: Paid by the recipient
- **Sending**: Paid by the sender

## Phone Number Hashing

StarkRemit uses phone number hashing for privacy and security:

- Phone numbers are hashed before storage
- Original phone numbers are never stored
- Only the hash is used for transactions
- Recipients must know their phone number to claim

## Daily Limits

The system has daily limits to prevent abuse:

- **Paymaster Daily Limit**: Maximum STRK sponsored per day
- **Individual Limits**: May be implemented per user
- **System Limits**: Overall system capacity limits

## Expiry and Refunds

### Automatic Expiry
- Remittances expire after 90 days
- Unclaimed remittances are automatically refunded
- Refunds go back to the original sender

### Manual Refunds
- Senders can request refunds for expired remittances
- Refunds are processed automatically
- No additional fees for refunds

## Security Features

### Pause Mechanism
- System can be paused in emergencies
- Prevents new remittances during pause
- Existing remittances remain claimable

### Amount Limits
- Minimum remittance: 1 STRK
- Maximum remittance: 1,000,000 STRK
- Limits can be adjusted by administrators

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- Protection against invalid data
- Error messages for guidance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Insufficient Balance"
- **Cause**: Not enough STRK tokens
- **Solution**: Add more STRK to your wallet

#### "Amount Too Small"
- **Cause**: Amount below minimum limit
- **Solution**: Increase the amount to at least 1 STRK

#### "Phone Has Pending Remittance"
- **Cause**: Phone number already has unclaimed remittance
- **Solution**: Wait for current remittance to be claimed or expired

#### "Gasless Claim Failed"
- **Cause**: Paymaster cannot sponsor gas
- **Solution**: Use manual claim instead

#### "Remittance Not Found"
- **Cause**: No remittance exists for phone number
- **Solution**: Verify phone number and check if remittance was sent

### Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Contract is paused" | System temporarily disabled | Wait for system to resume |
| "Amount must be greater than fee" | Insufficient amount for fee | Increase amount |
| "Invalid phone hash" | Phone number validation failed | Check phone number format |
| "Already claimed" | Remittance already claimed | Check transaction history |
| "Not expired yet" | Remittance not yet expired | Wait for expiry date |

## Best Practices
