# Gas Optimization Analysis for StarkRemit

## Current Gas Usage Analysis

### Paymaster Contract Gas Usage

**High Gas Operations:**
1. **Storage Reads/Writes**: Multiple storage operations in `sponsor_claim`
2. **Daily Usage Tracking**: Complex daily reset logic
3. **Event Emissions**: Multiple events with large data structures
4. **External Calls**: ERC20 token transfers

**Gas Optimization Opportunities:**

#### 1. Batch Storage Operations
- Combine multiple storage reads into single operations
- Use storage pointers more efficiently
- Minimize storage writes in hot paths

#### 2. Optimize Daily Usage Logic
- Cache current day calculation
- Reduce storage operations for daily resets
- Use more efficient data structures

#### 3. Event Optimization
- Reduce event data size where possible
- Use indexed fields efficiently
- Consider removing non-essential event data

#### 4. External Call Optimization
- Minimize external contract calls
- Cache contract addresses
- Optimize gas estimation

### RemittanceEscrow Contract Gas Usage

**High Gas Operations:**
1. **ERC20 Transfers**: Token transfers are expensive
2. **Storage Operations**: Multiple reads/writes for remittance data
3. **Paymaster Integration**: External calls to paymaster
4. **Event Emissions**: Large event structures

**Gas Optimization Opportunities:**

#### 1. Optimize Token Transfers
- Batch multiple transfers where possible
- Use more efficient transfer patterns
- Minimize approval operations

#### 2. Storage Optimization
- Pack data structures more efficiently
- Reduce storage reads in hot paths
- Use storage pointers effectively

#### 3. Paymaster Integration
- Cache paymaster contract address
- Optimize gas estimation
- Reduce external calls

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Storage Layout Optimization
```cairo
// Current: Multiple storage slots
struct Storage {
    owner: ContractAddress,
    token_address: ContractAddress,
    // ... other fields
}

// Optimized: Pack related data
struct PackedData {
    owner: ContractAddress,
    token_address: ContractAddress,
    // Pack small fields together
}
```

### 2. Batch Operations
```cairo
// Instead of multiple individual operations
fn batch_operations(ref self: ContractState, operations: Array<Operation>) {
    // Process multiple operations in single transaction
}
```

### 3. Caching Strategy
```cairo
// Cache frequently accessed data
struct CachedData {
    current_day: u64,
    last_update: u64,
    // Cache expensive calculations
}
```

### 4. Event Optimization
```cairo
// Use smaller event structures
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct OptimizedEvent {
    #[key]
    id: felt252,
    // Only essential data
    amount: u256,
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Storage optimization and batch operations
2. **Medium Priority**: Caching and external call optimization
3. **Low Priority**: Event optimization and minor improvements

## Expected Gas Savings

- **Storage Operations**: 15-25% reduction
- **External Calls**: 10-20% reduction
- **Overall Transaction**: 20-30% reduction

## Testing Gas Optimization

1. Benchmark current gas usage
2. Implement optimizations incrementally
3. Test each optimization separately
4. Measure gas savings
5. Verify functionality remains intact
